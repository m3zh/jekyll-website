				<p>Future Fiction is an independent publishing house, specialised in science fiction novels, which I have been runnning since 2014.</p><br>
				<h4>FUTURE FICTION IS FICTION OF IDEAS</h4><br>
				<p>It's a strong “what if” premise taking place in a few pages and matching the growing spread of e-readers, tablets and smartphones to engage everybody, strong and casual readers</p><br>
				<h4>FUTURE FICTION IS A MULTICULTURAL PROJECT PRESERVING THE FUTURE’S BIODIVERSITY</h4><br>
				<p>As in the Svalbard Islands a seed vault has been built to preserve the genetic heritage of plants from a possible environmental catastrophe, we preserve the memetic heritage of the future from a possible cultural catastrophe.</p><br>
				<h4>FUTURE FICTION IS WHAT MAKES REALITY OBSOLETE FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL, POLITICAL OR ETHICAL POINT OF VIEW</h4><br>
				<p>Our stories challenge common sense and status quo, encourage new ways of thinking and behaving, because Science Fiction is the Fiction of Transformation.</p><br>
				<h4>FUTURE FICTION IS A CROSSMEDIA PLATFORM</h4><br>
				<p>A storytelling lab allowing a story to transform from a written form into a recited one; audiobooks and graphic novels, performative theater and short films, multimedia installation and 3D-printed objects: whatever the medium, our intention is to spread the Seeds of the Future with any possible means allowed by current technologies.</p><br>
				<span></span>
				<p>We tell augmented stories exploring the ambiguous relationship between humans and technologies, the transformation of personal identities and social organizations, the crossroads of humanity dealing with scarcity or abundance of resources: all the visions peering into all possible tomorrows. Many are the worlds out there, and thus many are the futures. We believe in each and every one of them and we want to depict them all.</p><br>
