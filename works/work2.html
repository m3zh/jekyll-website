					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p class="synopsis">
						<b>This book obtained the 2008 Urania Mondadori Award (the most prestigious Award in Italy for Science Fiction Literature) as best Science Fiction Title of the year.</b>
						<br>
						<b>Motivation of the Jury</b>: A very good thriller, with an excellent, very analytic environment description of a next future – as background. Inside the very well articulated action rhythm of the really pregnant plot of his work, the Author finds the space for a wide, very sensitive reflection about the most genuine kind of human, passionate love.
						<br>
						<b>Plot</b>: Maya, a restless Moscovite teenager pretends to be an e-doll and leads a double life. On the one hand, she’s a lazy student, while on the other, she sells her body to feel loved. Angel, a hermaphrodite e-doll expert in the art of loving meditates upon how to become a human being. The two characters meet in a <i>sex-o-teque</i> and exchange <i>something</i> that will bring them closer to their fulfilment.
