						Those immune to the drug are placed at the apex of power, leading the population towards a sentiment of mass joy, convinced that it consists in physical and intellectual <i>augmentation</i> of any economic, social and anatomical system.
						Once the real reason of the project had been discovered, some scientists managed to escape and others were killed. The survivors formed an underground movement called KarmaRadio that tries to save as many people as possible and develop an antivirus for the Manna.
