				<b>Theme</b>: An imaginary city is endangered by the spread of “kipple” (garbage & trash) that overruns everything. Most of the people live by recycling and reusing dump materials, while a lucky few upload themselves into new artificial bodies. They are called nexhumans and represent the upcoming evolution of man (post humanism).
				<br>
				<b>Plot</b>: Peter Pains, a 15 year-old disabled “trashformer”, sees his older brother Charlie, leader of a teenage gang called The Dead Bones, killing Alba, a nexhuman girl. Peter is in love with her and decides to gather her electronic body parts to rebuild her with the help of Ion, a homeless tramp. Peter will have to face the members of the Dead Bones one by one to recover all of Alba. And it will take him more than 15 years to accomplish it. The novel has three alternative ending, each one leading to a different solution.
