				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p class="synopsis">
					<b>Theme</b>: The Pulldogs have left Rome to embrace a new condition: leaving no trace of their passage, they shape a new challenging lifestyle: wandering around the world as neo-nomads to spread their alternative way of living or to engage on a never-ending mission to save endangered human cultures with nanites.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Plot</b>: The vision of Alan and Nicolas about how the Pulldogs should live collide and as a consequence, they split in two groups: one goes North to live in the beautiful wilderness of Siberia and Mongolia, while the other goes South to save the Dogon tribe from a possible extinction due to climate change in Central Africa. But at the end everybody - including a new generation of Pulldogs - will have to come back to Rome, where their incredible transformation started many years before.
