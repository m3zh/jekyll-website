				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p class="synopsis">Full of savage humour, Francesco Verso imagines a tax system in Italy based upon blood. Amazingly this has nothing to do with actual zombies (to bend a bit the word “actual”). Weirdly, BloodBusters is plausible, and powerfully written, a high-spirited page-turner thanks to a great translation by Sally McCorry. Definitely this is the book to read after a holiday in Rome (though maybe not before). I shan’t forget in a hurry Verso’s Intravenous Revenue or the haemergency sirens and flashers of the taxbulance.”
-- Ian Watson, author of the screen story for Steven Spielberg’s A.I. Artificial Intelligence

Theme: What if taxes were paid by citizens through blood withdrawals? What if tax evasion was a crime punishable with imprisonment and enforced by the Bloodbusters? What if donating blood was an illegal procedure? And what if Ematogen, a delicious snack derived from blood, was everyone’s favourite food?

Plot: In a grotesque Rome, Alan Costa, a Bloodbuster operator, falls in love with Anissa Malesano, a compulsive donor  for the Robin Blood underworld organisation, who gives her blood to anyone in need. In a crescendo of deceit and treachery, where he cannot even trust his colleague Farid Sedef or his own boss Emory Sziliagy, Alan sees Anissa ending up in jail for tax evasion. Once he discovers the real reason why he was recruited as a Bloodbuster, Alan decides to sacrifice his own job and a precious part of himself to rescue Anissa and her son Nicola.
